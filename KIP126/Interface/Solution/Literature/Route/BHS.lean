/-! BHS source specialization and selected-to-completed comparison.

The source adapters below consume the delivered source statements and retain
the hypotheses of BHS A.1(2) and cor:tau-surj (Source/BHS/source/SynRevBigraded.tex
and SynRevAdams.tex). Finite Cλ lifting is intentionally separate.

The construction theorem uses bounded-below mod-two completion and the
finite-type sphere, its actual ν cofiber, the identified connective tmf,
and their shifts. The image and divisibility comparisons are internal
proof obligations. The standard classical sphere is already derived 2-complete. The generic
comparison language retains actual completion maps without identifying an
arbitrary selected object with its completion by definition.
No theorem in this file invokes the aggregate Challenge2 production target.

/-- Apply BHS `cor:synth-ctau-ASS` (1),(3) on the same supplied synthetic
family and positive finite lambda quotient. This projection retains all
finite pages r >= 2 and both weight inequalities. It does not derive an
E3 or E7 zero region from an E-infinity-only comparison, and it supplies no
new computation result. The source background must prove this field along
with its other BHS source statements. -/

The hypotheses contain actual q/νq maps, canonical detection comparison,
realization naturality, and the precise prescribed/torsion image reflections.
The proof uses λ naturality and the source clauses; it never calls a paper
proposition, Challenge2, or a high125 conclusion. -/

/-- Choose actual completed sources and prove the comparisons needed to return
to the selected classical objects. Only connective and finite-mod-two-type
scope is needed from tmf; neither high125 nor its detection is a premise. B fixes the detector, its actual unit, and labels.
For `.nuCofiber`, the source of q is definitionally the cofiber of the SAME
D.auxiliary.nuMap; the proof uses completion of that cofiber and shift closure.

This internal producer constructs Q and its comparisons. In the selected
HF₂-local classical category the chosen sphere, finite Hopf cofiber and
connective finite-type detector are already local; the identity comparison
is available after their nilpotent-completeness and convergence are proved.
No source theorem is inferred for an arbitrary synthetic category here. -/
