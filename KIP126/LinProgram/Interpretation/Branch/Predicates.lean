# Conditional meaning and candidate coverage

These predicates state mathematical obligations, not a soundness theorem
for the pinned program. Retaining a trial, decoding its depth, or finding
nonempty `info` does not discharge any of them. A refutation may instead use
mathematical consequences of nested trials; no text-based contradiction
criterion is imposed.
