/-- The two d₂-image facts consumed in the proof of prop:state5false,
aimpaper/main.tex:2716 and 2726. Sources have degrees (10,136) and (11,137),
but their coordinates are not guessed. These are explicit input propositions,
not consequences of E₂ multiplication or of later whole-page vanishing.
The pinned CSV witnesses and algebra certificates have now been independently
checked by scripts/check-near126-product-boundaries.py; their locators and the
remaining archive-to-actual-differential comparison are recorded in
docs/NEAR126_R10_CERTIFICATE.md. That script does not populate this structure.

Only boundary membership is retained: the consumer does not require a separate
nonzero claim for the product. This weaker consequence of the paper's stated
nonzero hits also handles zero and linear combinations correctly. The synthetic
filtration consequences and P/Q candidate exhaustion are separate obligations. -/
