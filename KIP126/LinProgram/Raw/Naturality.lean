# One fixed native naturality target and its adjacent source candidate

These are lossless rows of the pinned log. The `N` tag and adjacent `D`
row do not prove either equation or that the latter is the full trace.
The selected `Ceta__S0` map is `top_cell` with `sus = 2` in `ss.json`.
It preserves filtration and lowers the displayed internal degree by two.
