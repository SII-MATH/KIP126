/-- The long-layer products and their projection squares are now constructed
from the three lower connecting lifts. Four boundary conditions are proved
from the sphere tower. Only the two cross boundary conditions, the relative
boundary identity, and Lin comparisons remain explicit obligations
for those constructed products, not axioms or claims of permanence. -/

/-- Alternative lower-page criterion: the two local first-differential
product rules provide the remaining descent conditions. The lower lifts,
their relative boundary identity, and Lin product comparisons are still
required; no witness for the local first-differential rules is postulated. -/
