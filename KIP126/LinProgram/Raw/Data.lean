# Lossless rows and syntactic codes of the pinned Lin log

Source version: Zenodo 14875701, `v126.3.cw49`, `SSeqCpp-master/ss`.
The schema is `mylog.h:53–55`; the insertion variants are
`mylog.cpp:25–58`. Every nullable column is retained as `Option`.
The signed SQL integers, raw strings, generated `stem`, and `info` are
preserved; this is not the normalized finite-differential export type.

The decoders below only describe program syntax. Neither a reason code,
a root-depth row, nor a sentinel establishes a mathematical conclusion.
No importer, table, CSV, or raw database is modified by these definitions.

The three distinguished values come from `main.h:20–25`. In particular,
999 is not interpreted as nonzero permanent survival, and 1001 is not a
finite-page differential (`ss.cpp:583–587`, OutCsI boundary branch). -/

/-- Exact scalar/vector normalization in `cofseq.cpp:899–914` after
`GetDiffAndLevel` returns. It intentionally retains the collision:
every level below 5000, including a boundary or the zero-vector level
-1, returns `(999, [])`; level 9000 with `NULL_DIFF = [-1]` does too.
Consequently this output cannot imply nonzero E∞ survival. -/
