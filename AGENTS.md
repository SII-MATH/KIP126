# KIP126 agent guidance

## Agent roles and scope

Agents running in this repository operate in one of two roles:

1. **General-purpose agents** have broad repository access appropriate to their
   assigned task. They are not restricted by the worker-only source boundaries
   below, but remain governed by their task, higher-priority instructions, review
   and merge authorization, and all other repository policies in this file.
2. **Workers** receive one concrete implementation task: either rewrite or complete
   Lean Blueprint source, or implement Lean code. The worker-only contract below
   applies whenever an agent is assigned in that role.

If the task does not explicitly establish that the agent is a worker, do not infer
worker status solely because the task touches Lean or Blueprint files.

## Worker source boundaries

The bound worker skills define the generic authoring, review, and pull-request
workflow. This repository supplies only the mode-specific editable directories:

- Blueprint-only work may edit only files under `blueprint/src/`.
- Lean-only work may edit only `KIP126.lean` and `.lean` files under `KIP126/`.

If a worker task does not select exactly one mode, or requires a path outside the
selected boundary, stop before editing and request that the task be split or
clarified.

## Readiness and trust boundary

Use the `Project documents and workflow` section of `README.md` as the single map
of which project source answers each kind of question; do not duplicate that map
here. Before editing, base the work on the exact current default-branch head and
check the relevant Blueprint node, its status and dependencies against the actual
Lean declarations and import graph. Also check current issue, pull-request, CI,
and review evidence when they affect readiness. If those sources are missing,
stale, or contradictory, stop and report the conflict instead of guessing.

An unfinished proof may temporarily use `sorry` while it is being developed, but
do not mark the declaration or its Blueprint node as complete. A pull request is
not mergeable while the required axiom audit still reports `sorryAx`. Never add a
project-defined `axiom`. External hypotheses belong under `KIP126/External/` as
provenance-carrying `ExternalResult` or `ExternalEvidence` inputs, and conclusions
that use them must remain conditional statements taking those inputs explicitly.

## Validation policy

Use the cheapest evidence that answers the task. Do not start with a full build.

1. Inspect the requested change, the relevant diff, and existing validation evidence.
2. For post-merge reviews and read-only questions, check the merged PR checks and the
   successful `main` CI run for the exact merge SHA. If they cover the question, cite
   that evidence and do not repeat `lake build` or `leanblueprint all` locally.
3. Run a focused check only when existing evidence does not answer the question.
4. Deliver changes through a pull request. The required checks for the pull
   request's exact current head are the final mechanical merge gate; local checks
   provide earlier feedback but do not replace or duplicate that gate.

A fresh checkout has no local Lake packages or build outputs. Never run `lake build`
directly in that state: it clones dependencies and then cold-builds them. If local Lean
validation is actually needed, run the narrowest relevant target through the repository's
cache wrapper, for example:

```bash
bash scripts/shared-main-cache.sh run lake build KIP126.SomeModule
```

The wrapper first runs `lake exe cache get` without any project-cache environment, so
Mathlib artifacts still come from Mathlib's official cache. It then overlays KIP126's
latest successful `main` artifact cache from the single daemon's persistent checkout at
`/inspire/hdd/global_user/czxs25250150/KIP126/.lake/shared-main-cache` and executes the
requested command. Do not run `lake update` unless the task is specifically changing
dependency pins.

The persistent checkout `/inspire/hdd/global_user/czxs25250150/KIP126` and everything
under its `.lake/` directory are daemon-owned. Agents must not edit files there, run Git
or Lake write operations there, change permissions, retarget the `current` symlink, or
set that shared path as a writable cache. In particular, never set
`LAKE_ARTIFACT_CACHE=true` while using it and never run `lake cache clean` against it.
Agents may only read it through `scripts/shared-main-cache.sh run`; branch-specific misses
are built in the Agent's own checkout and do not enter the shared cache. If the wrapper
reports no matching cache or a daemon failure, stop and report it instead of modifying the
persistent checkout.

The daemon is the sole writer. It polls `origin/main`, fast-forwards the clean persistent
checkout, skips documentation-only changes using the committed build-input digest, pulls
Mathlib from the official cache, builds changed KIP126 inputs, and atomically publishes a
new immutable generation. Its lifecycle commands are reserved for daemon maintenance:
`bash scripts/shared-main-cache.sh start`, `stop`, and `status`.

GitHub Actions' `kip126-main-build-v2-*` cache contains trusted `.lake/build` output
keyed by OS, architecture, and the committed Lean/build-input digest. Documentation-only
`main` commits therefore reuse their parent's outputs, while Lean source, Lake config or
pins, and toolchain changes get a new key. The repository's workflows restore it
automatically; a Multica local checkout does not. The local wrapper described above uses
the daemon-owned Lake artifact cache instead, not GitHub Actions Cache. Do not claim that
either cache was reused unless the relevant restore actually ran. Prefer exact-SHA CI
results as evidence for read-only analysis.

## Check selection

- Lean source change: use `scripts/shared-main-cache.sh run` to check the changed module
  or smallest relevant target first. Run a full local `lake build` only when the task
  explicitly requests it or an unresolved question requires it.
- Blueprint prose or graph change: run `leanblueprint web`.
- Changed `\lean` annotations: regenerate the ignored `blueprint/lean_decls` with
  `leanblueprint web`, then run `lake exe checkdecls blueprint/lean_decls`.
- Changed Lean declaration names referenced by the Blueprint: follow the Lean source
  check above, regenerate `blueprint/lean_decls`, and run the same declaration check.
- Print-only Blueprint change: run `leanblueprint pdf`.
- Run `leanblueprint all` only when a task explicitly requires every Blueprint artifact
  or when changes span all of the checks above.
- Non-code/read-only investigation: do not compile solely as a generic preflight.

Before launching an expensive command, state which unresolved question it answers. If
the same commit already has a successful check covering that question, reuse it.
