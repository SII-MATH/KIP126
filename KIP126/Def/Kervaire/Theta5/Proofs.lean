# Project transport for the BJM/BX criterion

The literature theorem is only stated for its distinguished source choice.
The results below are the internal transport step: an explicit order and
filtration comparison identifies the `lambda eta` square of any order-two
choice with that of the source choice, and ordinary rewriting transports both
the finite and infinite BJM/BX equivalences.
