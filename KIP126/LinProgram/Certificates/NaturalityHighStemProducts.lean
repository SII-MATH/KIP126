/-! Three exact sphere quotient relations in the native context of log 462481.
The first reduces the extra Ceta-to-S0 matrix column; the second is used in
an ancestor trial's formal module calculation. The third reduces the
product used in a reconstruction of a prior native differential. These are statements in the
original 2914-generator quotient, not actual cofiber map or differential
certificates. All native generator identifiers are retained. -/
