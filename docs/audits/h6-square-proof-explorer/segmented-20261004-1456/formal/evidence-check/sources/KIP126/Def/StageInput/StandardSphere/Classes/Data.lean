/-! Standard labels on M's internal Adams sequence, independent of C(M).
The generic constructions live in Def and take the foundation and its Milnor
coordinates explicitly. Here they are specialized to Def's fixedImplementation.
No new object or correctness axiom is introduced by these definitions.

/-- The standard class of the cobar concatenation [ξ₁^64 | ξ₁^64].
This is the internal standard h₆² label for T(M), in (s,t) = (2,128), stem 126.
It is defined before, and independently of, any CSV encoding or comparison.
Its identification with a supplied page product is a separate compatibility
question; neither a product comparison nor permanence is assumed here. -/
