# Retained branch syntax in the pinned Lin log

Source: `v126.3.cw49`, `ss/deduce.cpp:329–389` and
`ss/mylog.cpp:120–148,151–206`. `TryDiff` deletes noncontradictory attempts;
retained T/TI rows are assumptions of attempted refutations, not conclusions.
The raw artifact has no `exclusions` table. Neither an exclusion certificate
nor a complete candidate list is reconstructed here.

Rows must be supplied in increasing database-id order. A trial at depth d
replaces the previous trial at that depth; the trials at smaller positive
depths are its enclosing context. Missing parents are reported, not invented.
Every output retains the complete raw row, including nullable/multiline info.
