# Interface/Solution/LinProgram/Products/Trial152097

Fixed-model Interface construction or conditional theorem. A supplied presentation is not constructed by its use.
Public Lean declaration names are preserved; the path identifies this module's
mathematical subject and role. See `KIP126/LinProgram/README.md` for contracts,
remaining comparison obligations and the module migration table.

/-! Transport the two native product identities through one supplied Lin E2
presentation. These are identities for that presentation's product; they do
not construct the presentation, compare its product with a tower pairing,
or prove the trial refutation or the retained differential record 152098. -/
