/-!
The path-space model of a homotopy fiber of an actual continuous map.
The topology is the subspace topology of the product of the source with the
compact-open path space. In particular, the source coordinate is not discrete,
and the endpoint condition retains a path rather than requiring equal points.
No comparison with a derived mapping space is asserted by this construction.
