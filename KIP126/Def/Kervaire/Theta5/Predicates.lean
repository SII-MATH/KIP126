# Predicates for the `theta_5` external boundary

The propositions in this file are interfaces.  Their proofs are supplied by a
located literature result or a checked finite computation; the definitions do
not assert any of the Kervaire conclusions themselves.

quantified only at the distinguished source choice; the project transport
theorem in `Proofs.lean` supplies the arbitrary-choice form. -/

The existential side is the dimension-indexed statement used by the endpoint
theorems; the Adams permanence predicate is supplied by the same fixed sphere
