# LinProgram/Certificates/Products/Trial152097

Fixed-data certificate in the original complete quotient or module; it supplies no actual-spectrum comparison.
Public Lean declaration names are preserved; the path identifies this module's
mathematical subject and role. See `KIP126/LinProgram/README.md` for contracts,
remaining comparison obligations and the module migration table.
-/

/-! Closed certificates for the two product reductions used in the native
proofs.db trial 152097, preceding the retained D record 152098. The conclusion
is about the fixed CSV quotient E2. No Adams differential or basis independence
is inferred from these algebraic identities. -/
