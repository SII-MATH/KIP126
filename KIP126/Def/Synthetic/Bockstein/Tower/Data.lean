# The actual residual λ tower and its represented spectral sequences

The tower is extended constantly at all nonpositive indices from its actual
zeroth object `biShift (0,0) A`.  Its negative tail is not replaced by positive
weight shifts of `A`.  At each fixed weight the first page and differential
come from the specified cofiber layers of that tower.
